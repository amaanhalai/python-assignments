# Files, Exceptions, and Errors in Python - Assignment 4

This repository contains two Python scripts:

- `task1_read_file.py`: Reads from 'sample.txt' and prints each line; handles the case where the file does not exist.
- `task2_write_append_file.py`: Takes user input, writes and appends to 'output.txt', then displays the final content.

Each file can be run independently to test its behaviors.
