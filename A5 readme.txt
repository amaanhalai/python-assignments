# Data Structures and Strings in Python - Assignment 5

This repository contains two Python scripts:

- `task1_student_marks.py`: Uses a dictionary to store student marks and retrieves them based on user input, with error handling for unknown students.
- `task2_list_slicing.py`: Demonstrates list slicing by extracting and reversing the first five elements of a list from 1 to 10.

Run the scripts independently to see their respective outputs.
