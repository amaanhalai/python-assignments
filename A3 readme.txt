# Functions & Modules in Python - Assignment 3

This repository has two Python scripts for Assignment 3 in Module 4:

- `task1_factorial.py`: Defines a function to calculate the factorial of a given number using recursion and displays the result.
- `task2_math_module.py`: Uses the math module to compute and display the square root, natural logarithm, and sine (in radians) of a user-provided number.

Each script runs independently and demonstrates core concepts of functions and library usage in Python.
